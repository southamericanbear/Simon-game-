# Simon-game-

This is one my first project.
First I created with the jQuery library and then I decided to wirte all the code again in pure vanilla javaScript.



It's the classic simon game, in which you have to repeat the sequence that the machine is throwing and if you get the wrong sequence then you lost.


ENJOY!
